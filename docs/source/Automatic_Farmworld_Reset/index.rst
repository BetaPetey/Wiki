What Are Automatic Farmworld Resets?
====================================

Automatic Farmworld Resets or AFR for short, is a system on MineYourMind that completely resets a dimension or world at a given point in time. If we didn't do this, worlds like The End or the Nether would be completely destroyed and/or looted after a certain point the server opened. When we reset it, it becomes an untouched, clean world.

What Type of Farmworld Resets Are there?
========================================

Currently there are two types of resets on MineYourMind. We have **Weekly** and **Monthly** resets. The time varies for worlds and when they reset by MineYourMind Administrators. Administrators look at the demands of a world/dimension and see how heavly the world is used up in resources.

When Exactly Do These Resets Happen?
====================================

* **Weekly** - Saturday
* **Monthly** - The *1st* of each month

The reset happens on the first restart of that day
**The timezone of the server is GMT+1/2 (Winter/Summer)**

Which Worlds Are on the Reset List Currently?
=============================================

We have two different lists here. We have `General`_ and the `Server Specific Exceptions`_. The General list meaning that these worlds are, by default, ones that reset weekly, montly or never respectively. The Server Specific Exceptions are ones that deviate from the General list or the defaults.
