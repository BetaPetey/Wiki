Antimatter Chemistry
====================

Concept
-------
Antimatter Chemistry is a questing/progression pack inspired by Anti-Material Energy (1.7.10) by Parcel31u. You find yourself stranded in the Antimatter dimension with nothing but some basic gear, a chemistry set, and the hopes of returning back to your home.

Coming in at about 100 mods, this pack loads quick and performs well on potato computers, but still remains a unique hand-crafted and engaging experience that can provide dozens of hours of fun.

More info about the pack can be found `here <https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/antimatter-chemistry>`_.
