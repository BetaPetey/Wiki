Stoneblock 3
============

Concept
-------
Welcome to Stoneblock 3!

StoneBlock 3 is here and there's more action and adventure waiting for you than ever before! In
a world of rock and stone, release your inner dwarf and build your subterranean kingdom! Use
magic and technology to forge your realm to your designs. Make your dimension your own, or
play with friends. Featuring a free-form sandbox-style play with lots of quests and goals to guide
you through the pack. With scripted events and interactions for players to explore along their
adventure, you know every experience will be unique. With StoneBlock's unique map
generation the world and its biomes are created in concentric circles around your base meaning
adventures to the nether or end are never more than a pickaxe (or 20) away!
